## Trystan's Dotfiles!

Enviroment customizations for a POSIX shell and some other stuff. This is made with MacOS in mind but most of it is POSIX compliant and should mostly work on Linux/Unix machines.

To Install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TrystanKaes/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles && sh setup.sh
```
